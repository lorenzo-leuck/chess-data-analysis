This repository is to help all chess players utilize and work with [public chess profile data](http://ratings.fide.com/download_lists.phtml) provided by the `FIDE` organization (through December 2019). FIDE's website can be cumbersome to work with and has limited visuals about chess players. My hope is that this project helps users avoid the pain of using their website and provide interesting insights to the chess community.

The project is divided into 6 steps, which are outlined [here](https://github.com/AnujDahiya24/FIDE-Chess-Data#-lifecycle-of-data).

# üìà Dashboard

To see ratings in real-time, I've created a dashboard to help chess players [here](https://anujdahiya24.shinyapps.io/apps/).

# üó∫Ô∏è Where is the data?

The data is located in this [folder](https://github.com/AnujDahiya24/FIDE-Chess-Data/tree/master/Chess%20Scripts/Step%204%20-%20Cleaning/Cleaned%20csvs).

The folder contains over a hundred `.csv` files, from January 2001 to December 2019, that can be analyzed.

If you have suggestions on different data formats you'd like, please state them in [Issues](https://github.com/AnujDahiya24/FIDE/issues).

Other than that, feel free to use it as you see fit.

# ‚ôüÔ∏è Why did I do this?

I chose to work on this project because of several reasons:

- FIDE's publically available data is in an unorganized layout. There is no "download all datasets" button to acquire all of their data. FIDE also doesn't publically list data prior to February 2015 on the new download page when there is actually data going back as early as 2001. As a result, site visitors may find FIDE's website frustrating to work with and I wanted to help overcome their struggles.

- Chess players like to see visuals of themselves, friends, competitors, top players and players across various demographics. I wanted to provide these visuals.

- I wanted to improve my skills in 2 programming languages.

- I've always taken an interest in any data about chess that has not been extensively analyzed. My curiosity drives me.

# üìö Introduction 

The first step has us downloading the profile player data (zipped text files) from [FIDE's website](http://ratings.fide.com/download_lists.phtml). Feel free to explore FIDE's [new] website. It seems as if data prior to 2015 is not being displayed anymore. Thankfully, all of the URLs still host the `.zip` files that we will download and are **not** broken.

If you want to: 

1. View the text files, see the `Data (all text files)` hyperlink below.
2. View the process of the data downloading, then see the `Tutorial` below
3. Run the script yourself, then you should download the `R-Markdown file` below and run it on your local machine.

# üîÑ Download the FIDE files

![Download](https://www.pngarts.com/files/2/Download-Button-Transparent-Background-PNG.png)

In order to download the player profile data, we will use something like the following snippet:

```
#R function that downloads FIDE data files and skips over non-existing URLs

download_function <- function(link, dest){
  if (!file.exists(dest)) {
    tryCatch({
      download.file(link, dest, method="auto", quiet = TRUE) 
    }, error=function(e){})
  }
} 

#Download all data files from URLs and direct them to a folder

mapply(download_function, url_vector, url_vect_destfile)
```

in order to download all files of interest and puts them into a destination folder. 

Please see the `Tutorial` and `R-Markdown` file for further reference.

# üìö Introduction

The second step has us modifying all of the text files from FIDE's website. In order to modify all of the files quickly, we will utilize parallel processing: It's a big time saver.

If you want to:

1. View the .csv files, see the `Data (all csv files)` hyperlink below.
2. View the process of the data downloading, then see the `Tutorial` below
3. Run the script yourself, then you should download the `R-Markdown file` below and run it on your local machine.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues

After downloading the files in Step 1, I wasn't able to import text files downloaded from [FIDE's data download page](http://ratings.fide.com/download_lists.phtml), into R. A typical `read.csv()` statement will not work because the data has no defined delimiter to parse columns on.  

For example, the earliest dataset on FIDE's website is from January 2001. Let's take a moment to look at the first few rows of the raw text file.

```
ID_NUMBER NAME                             TITLE COUNTRY JAN01 GAMES FLAG
 
 1701991  Aaberg, Anton                          SWE     2300    0   i   
 1401815  Aagaard, Jacob                   m     DEN     2374   18       
 1406248  Aage, Bjarke                           DEN     2063    0       
```

There are several issues with working with the data, but the most pressing one is that there is no clear delimiter to import the files on. A regular comma delimiter will not work because the text does not contain commas to separate the columns. Whitespace and tab delimiters won't work either.

One [github user](https://github.com/xdurana/fider/blob/master/R/zzz.R) has imported FIDE data via fixed widths. This works quite well for most, if not all of the data and I'll look into reading in the text files faster using this [stackoverflow post's](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24715894/faster-way-to-read-fixed-width-files) benchmarking results.

When I first started working on this project, I didn't quite understand it required fixed-width functions such as `read_fwf()`. I was new to R and my main motivation was I wanted to learn R and Python in a creative setting.

There are several other issues with the rest of the text files (Text files run from January 2001 through December 2019). Just to name a few (shown with table visuals):

### Some have misspelled columns and ever-changing column names over time

```
ID NUMBER NAME                             TIT  Fed     JAN   GMs FLAG
 
 1701991  Aaberg, Anton                         SWE     2300    0   i       
 1401815  Aagaard, Jacob                   m    DEN     2374   18       
 1406248  Aage, Bjarke                          DEN     2063    0       
```  
- `ID NUMBER` is not `ID_NUMBER`, which is problematic for various programmatic reasons.
- `TIT` is different from `TITLE`
- `FED` is different from `Country`.
- `GMs` is different from `Games`
- `JAN` should be `JAN01`

### Some have their columns out of line or missing columns labels outright


```
ID_NUMBER   NAME                        TITLE   COUNTRYJAN01        FLAG
 
 1701991  Aaberg, Anton                          SWE     2300    0   i   
 1401815  Aagaard, Jacob                   m     DEN     2374   18       
 1406248  Aage, Bjarke                           DEN     2063    0       
```
- `NAME` is out of position
- `COUNTRY` and `JAN01` are one word instead of being separated into two
- `GAMES` is missing

### Some have blank & missing rows

```
ID_NUMBER NAME                             TITLE COUNTRY JAN01 GAMES FLAG
 
 1701991  Aaberg, Anton                          SWE     2300    0   i   

 1406248  Aage, Bjarke                           DEN     2063    0       
```
- The entire 2nd row is missing (Jacob Aagaard's information is missing).

### Some don‚Äôt even have column headers

```  
 1701991  Aaberg, Anton                          SWE     2300    0   i   
 1401815  Aagaard, Jacob                   m     DEN     2374   18       
 1406248  Aage, Bjarke                           DEN     2063    0       
```
- The column headers aren't even included in the data.

# üßπ Reformat files

![](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/blogs/files/2008/07/310.png)

As a result, our next step is to work through each file and transform them into a usable format. The approach I took was to insert delimiters at each index (based on the column line) where a space followed by a character occurred. For example, the data, after inserting `*` delimiters, would look something like this:

```
ID_NUMBER*NAME                            *TITLE*COUNTRY*JAN01*GAMES*FLAG
 
 1701991 *Aaberg, Anton                   *     *SWE    *2300 *  0  *i   
 1401815 *Aagaard, Jacob                  *m    *DEN    *2374 * 18  *    
 1406248 *Aage, Bjarke                    *     *DEN    *2063 *  0  *    
```
where we can clearly see `*` delmiters have been inserted at indexes where a whitespace occured and was one index before another character.

**Note:** Approximately ~14000 observations contain faulty Title and Flag/Activity information. These will be addressed in future iterations of the project.

The `multi_processing()` function below is the general wrapper that weaves everything together (importing, inserting delimiters, export reformatted data to `.csv` format.

```
#run All_files_fwrite() in parallel

multi_processing <- function(Year_num){
                    functions = ls(globalenv())
                    cl <- makeCluster(detectCores())
                    clusterExport(cl, functions)
                    registerDoParallel(cl)
                    foreach(i = Year_num,
                            .export = functions,
                            .packages = c("dplyr",
                                          "data.table",
                                          "Kmisc")) %dopar% {All_files_fwrite(i)}
                    stopCluster(cl)
                                      }
```
After this function is executed on every one of the `.txt` files, they will become usable `.csv` files.

# üìö Introduction 

The thirds step has us scraping a table of FIDE Country Codes from this [URL](https://www.olimpbase.org/help/help41.html). This is a handy table to convert the `Country` column values over to more interpretable values in Step 4. In hindsight, I could have saved myself some time by looking at this [link](http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/palview/p3manual/p3flags.htm) within the URL I linked above.

If you want to: 

1. View the table, see the `Country Data` hyperlink below.
2. View/Run the program, see the scraping `Tutorial` below.

# üßπ Cleaning files

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*yWFQiGjlgHUVYeh4ELELyw.jpeg)


To clean the data, we will at some point need to modify each file's column names and values using something like the following in R:

```
#Iterate over each data.frame in list
for(i in 1:length(FIDE)){

#Rename columns in each dataset
  colnames(FIDE[[i]])[grepl("Name|NAME|name", colnames(FIDE[[i]]))] <- "Name"
  ...... more column editing ......
  ...... more column editing ......
  ...... more column editing ......
  colnames(FIDE[[i]])[grepl("OTit", colnames(FIDE[[i]]))] <- "Other_Titles"
  
 #Clean each data.frame
  FIDE[[i]] <- FIDE[[i]] %>%
               mutate(Date = as.POSIXct(names(FIDE)[i], format="%Y-%m-%d"),
                      Date_numeric = year(Date)+yday(Date)/366,
                      Rating = as.numeric(Rating),
                      Title= c(new, Title)[match(Title, c(old, Title))],
                      Country = c(codes$Country, Country)[match(Country, c(codes$Code, Country))],
                      Country = c(countries, Country)[match(Country, c(country_codes, Country))])%>%
                      filter(!Country %in% c("Fed", "Col"))%>%
                      select(-one_of("V1"))
                      
  #Write to new file
  fwrite(FIDE[[i]] , file = paste(dest, files[i], sep = ""), sep = "*")
  
}
```
I'll look to parallelize this for loop to save time moving forward. 

**Note::** The `Age_Birthday` needs a considerable amount of work. Many of the dates have differing formats, so I will need to write a function that will reformat the data.

# üìö Introduction

Welcome to the analytical portion of this repository. There are several topics explored here, but countless more to explore over time.

A few examples of visuals in the `Tutorial` file below are:

- Total player counts over time
- Total players gained/lost over time
- Rating stability graphs
- Total player gained/lost over time by country (Countries with extreme values)
- Total titled player counts over time
- Total titled player counts by country (Latest month)
- Strongest countries by age group
- Age vs Rating by title (Latest month)

If you want to:
1. View the process of the data visualization, then see the `Tutorial` below
2. Run the script yourself, then you should download the `R-Markdown file` below and run it on your local machine.

# Visuals

Below is an experimental visualization I'm working on improving. It is **not** included in the Tutorial file: it is in the `Experiments` folder in `Step 6`.

#### FIDE player (Active) rating distribution of Males & Females over time.

![](https://github.com/AnujDahiya24/FIDE-Chess-Data/blob/master/Chess%20Scripts/Step%206%20-%20Experimental%20work/Experiments/Men_women_gif.gif)

I find this graph to be interesting because it shows a few strange trends:

- The graphs look like play-dough that has been slowly compressed over time.
- There were no players rated below 2200 in many of the early datasets provided by FIDE.
- Around 2014, both the male and female distributions looked fairly Gaussian in their shape
- Since 2014, FIDE's rating floor of 1000 has prevented players from naturally falling below the floor. I will look to explore the differences between the male and female distributions (both are heavily right-skewed, but the female distribution is even more so) moving forward. There's an interesting sociological phenomenon present here that has not been vocalized in public yet.

# ‚åö Time Length

Note: The `Analysis.pdf` file take several minutes to knit because of functions like `rbindlist()` that combine all of the datasets together.
